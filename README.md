# Library-Management-System

We have created separate logins for students and the librarian, in which the librarian is password protected.​

In this project, the librarian can add, update, delete and create books and can also assign the books to the students.​

The students can also view the list of the books available in the entire library database.​

The entire rights are given to the librarian to adding books, issuing books, and modify the book.​

This project uses file handling to store the data of books in a project.​

A Librarian can also be able to change the password.​

Reissuing and returning the books are the main features of this project.​

The student can also be able to see which student has already borrowed the book
